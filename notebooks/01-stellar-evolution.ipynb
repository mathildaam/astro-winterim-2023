    "We've learned about the life cycles of stars: how they are born in [molecular gas clouds](https://esahubble.org/images/heic0601a/), spend most of their lifetimes fusing hydrogen into helium, then expand into red giants as they fuse heavier elements, until they run out of fuel and either [peacefully shed their outer layers](https://esahubble.org/images/heic1310a/), leaving behind a white dwarf (low mass stars) or [explode in dramatic supernovae](https://esahubble.org/images/heic0515a/), collapsing into a neutron star or black hole (high mass stars), leaving behind diffuse gas that may eventually form into more stars. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've also learned how these stages of a star's life appear to us on Earth and how to tell a star's fate by its position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We've even [played around](https://starinabox.lco.global/#) with how stars move along the diagram when they run out of hydrogen, ignite helium and heavier elements, and eventually run out of fuel completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll learn how to use the [astropy](https://www.astropy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) packages to read in a table of stars and their magnitudes and colors, then plot these in an HR diagram."

Hipparcos was the first space telescope devoted to performing astrometry, precisely measuring the positions of millions of stars and their movement within the Milky Way. Its successor, [Gaia](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia), is currently operating and recently published its third data release, which has increased the number of stars with these measurements to several billion, three orders of magnitude more!\n",
