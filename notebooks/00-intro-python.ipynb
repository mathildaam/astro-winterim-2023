    "Coding is an incredibly powerful tool in science, both for building models and analyzing data. In this course, we'll be working with [Python](https://www.python.org), a language that is both simple and powerful and very commonly used by professional astronomers. We'll be learning using [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org). \n",

    "## 0. How to use Jupyter\n",
    "This notebook is divided into cells, which either contain code or text. To run a cell, either click on the `run` button at the top of the notebook or press `shift`+`enter`, which will run the code or render the text in the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate with the arrow keys or by clicking on the cell you want to edit. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the box around the cell is green, you're in **edit mode** and you can type code or text into the cell. If the box around the cell is blue, you're in **command mode** and key presses correspond to different commands (kind of like the `control` or `command` button on your keyboard). You can press `Esc` to go to command mode if you're in edit mode, and `enter` to go to edit mode from command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click the `+` button or press `a` or `b` (in command mode) to create a new code cell. You can change to a markdown cell by toggling in the dropdown menu at the top (which will say \"Code\" or \"Markdown\"), or by pressing `m` in command mode (change back to a code cell by pressing `y`). \n",
